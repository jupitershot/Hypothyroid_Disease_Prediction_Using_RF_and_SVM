Date: 3rd Feb 2020
#### By **Kennedy Njoroge**

## Description
A clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism was conducted and data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Models were developed to determine whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

Classifiers used are:
1. Decision tree based classifers :- Random forests, Ada boosted trees, and gradient boosted trees.
2. SVM - Apply Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel functions and compare their performances
